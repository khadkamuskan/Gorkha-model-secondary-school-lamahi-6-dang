<p ><font size=4>Gorkha Group was established by 97 ex-British/Indian army servicemen in Nepal’s Lumbini State in the year 1998. One of the primary objectives of the Group was to work on improving the education sector of the area. The group invested in health care and agricultural businesses in the intervening years. Gorkha Group has invested tremendously in school education and has enjoyed astounding success in serving the people of the Lumbini State. Gorkha International Public Higher Secondary school was the first school established with motto “Education is the Light” by the group in Dang.
