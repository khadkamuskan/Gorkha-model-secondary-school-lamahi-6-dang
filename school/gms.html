<p> <font color=black size=4>A clique of Ninety Seven Lahures (Nepalese who served in the British Army) determined to spread the light of education in the Lumbine State of Nepal established Gorkha International Public Secondary school with the motto “Education is the Light” in Ghorahi Municipality-14, Dang on 1998. The common purpose of establishing the school was to provide skill-based education to children of the area that the Lahures were deprived of when they were young and were forced to seek opportunities in the foreign land as illiterates. The group of 97 which is now called Gorkha Group has been a major contributor to introducing child-centered teaching approach in children-friendly environment in the Lumbine State . What started as a small school in Gorhahi just two decades back is now a school of 2500 pupils and 150 teachers and staff.
<br>
<br>
Gorkha Group has collaborated with local intellectuals and nationally renowned personalities to establish Gorkha Model School which has been in operation since 2018 and serving 1500 students now.
